# Netflix_shows_analysis
Analyzing the Netflix data using Pandas 

This beginner-level project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset using only Pandas.



## About the Project

In this project, I worked on a real-world dataset from Netflix and applied core Pandas techniques like:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature Extraction (like duration in minutes, age-based ratings)
- Filtering and Aggregation
- Date and Time parsing
- Grouping, Sorting, and Logical Conditions



## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Google Colab



## Tasks Performed

- Converted string columns like `date_added` into datetime
- Cleaned `duration` column to extract numeric values
- Categorized ratings into age groups (Kids, Teens, Adults)
- Filtered movies longer than 2 hours
- Found top directors of TV Shows
- Created new columns like `AgeGroup` and `duration_int`



## Key Insights

- Majority of Netflix content is either for adults or teens
- Several shows and movies have missing directors
- Most movies fall between 90â€“120 minutes
- Very few long-duration movies (over 2 hours)



## Dataset Source

You can find the Netflix dataset on:
[Kaggle Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)



## What I Learned

- How to clean messy real-world data
- Using Pandas for filtering, transformation, and logic
- Date handling and creating custom groupings
- Best practices for building reproducible Pandas workflows



## Future Improvements

- Add visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Turn this into a complete EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) notebook
- Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit
